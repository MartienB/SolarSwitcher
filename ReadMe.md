The goal of the SolarSwitcher project is to develop a device which can switch between different power supplies in order to (in this case) power a Raspberry Pi. 

One of the connected power suppies is a small solar panel and battery, the goal is to use this power source as much as possible, but when the battery runs low, a wallcharger will take over.
