The goal of the SolarSwitcher project is to develop a device which can switch between different power supplies in order to (in this case) power a Raspberry Pi. 

One of the connected power suppies is a small solar panel and battery, the goal is to use this power source as much as possible, but when the battery runs low, a wallcharger will take over.

Version 1:

Design based around a simple relay board and using micro USB connectors for connecting the input power sources.

Version 2:
Replaced relay board for relay, diode and two leds (with resistors). Micro USB connectors where to fragile in the first version so we're now using USB B connectors
